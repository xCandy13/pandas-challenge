## Analysis
Upon reviewing the spending ranges per student, it seems the lower the spending per student, the higher the average math and reading scores. As a result, overall passing percentages are highest in the smallest spending per student range. However, looking at the size_summary DataFrame, we can see that a larger school (which may cause the budget to be split across more students) does not correspond to better test scores; in fact, the opposite is true - smaller schools have better scores.
The disparity may have a solution found in the type_summary DataFrame, which compares 'Charter' schools and 'District' schools. 'Charter' schools see much higher average scores and passing percentages than 'District' schools. Since 'District' schools receive much more public funding than 'Charter' schools (see the column 'Total School Budget' in the per_school_summary DataFrame), they will have a much higher spending per student, but we lack private funding data.
